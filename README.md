# 3D models

This repository contains the various 3D models that I have created for my own use. 

## Models

Images should be pretty self-explanatory

 * Triple-laptop holder for Carbon X1 laptops. 18mm "gaps". Print with 50% infill. [model](models/3-laptop-stand.stl)
 * GPU "spreader" for quad-GPU machines. Improves airflow.
 * Cat food paper bowl holder.

## Notes on printing

These models were printed on a Prusa i3 Mk3 extrusion 3D printer. 
Be sure to lay the models flat on the bed for successful prints.
